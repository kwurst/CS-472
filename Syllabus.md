## Prerequisites
* CS 254 Computer Organization and Architecture
* CS 282 UNIX Systems Programming

This course has a prerequisite of CS 254 Computer Organization and Architecture. A basic understanding of digital logic circuits, computer architecture, and assembly language programming is useful for more advanced robotics topics, such as may be needed in the final project.

This course has a prerequisite of CS 282 UNIX Systems Programming. I expect you to be able to write programs of intermediate difficulty in the C programming language.

***If you are missing any of this background, you should not take this course.***

## Course Format

This course will be taught as a hands-on laboratory course and a readings-based seminar course.
The laboratory portion of the course will involve the introduction of robotics technology and programming techniques by the instructor, followed by a challenge task to be implemented by the students using the new material.
The readings-based seminar portion of the course will involve the assignment of specific readings by the instructor, and discussion and/or written summaries of the material by the students.
You are encouraged to help each other out, in and out of the classroom, as long as you do your own work. (See Academic Conduct below.)

## Course Objectives

This course will introduce the student to behavior-based robotics and engineering design. Basic mechanical concepts such as drive-trains and gear reduction will be taught. Control strategies and their programming (including multi-processing) will be covered.
This course will deal with issues that are often not addressed in other computer science courses such as integration of hardware and software components, the effects of uncertainty due to operating in the physical world, teamwork, and critical thinking.
Students will experience the excitement of building a working physical device, will be encouraged to excel in a public competition, and work creatively to complete a task that has no single correct solution.
## Course-Level Student Learning Outcomes

## Grading Policies

I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: X and Y. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome X, and a grade of 40 for outcome Y, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome Y.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on a ***Meets Specification***/***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification.
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in a ***Meets Specification*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading

* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis.
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be marked *Meets Specification*.**
* Failing to meet ***any part*** of the specification will result in the work being marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**.
* There will be no partial credit given.
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with **Does Not Yet Meet Specification** grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an acceptable manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn Base Grade<br>A | Earn Base Grade<br>B | Earn Base Grade<br>C | Earn Base Grade<br>D
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Lab Attendance: Labs 1-6 | All | All | All | All
Lab Attendance: Weeks 7-8 | All | All | All | All
Lab Attendance: Weeks 10-16 | 7 (out of 7) | 6 (out of 7) | 5 (out of 7) | 4 (out of 7)
*Vehicles* Readings Summaries:<br>Introduction, Vehicles 1, 2, and 3 | All | All | All | All
*Vehicles* Readings Summaries: Vehicles 4-14 | 7 (out of 11)| 5 (out of 11) | 3 (out of 11) | 1 (out of 11)
Readings Summaries:<br>Miller [1993], Brooks [1986] | All | All | All | All
Engineering Design Notebook Entries: Labs 1-6 | All | All | All | All
Engineering Design Notebook Entry: Competition Project | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;
Engineering Design Notebook Entries:<br>Weeks 10-16 | 4 (out of 7) | 3 (out of 7) | 2 (out of 7) | 1 (out of 7)
Final Project Proposal | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;
Final Project Presentation | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;
Robotics Exhibit/Concert<br>Description and Impressions | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |
Robotics Exhibit/Concert<br>Analysis of Robotics Elements | &#10004; | &#10004;
Robotics Technology in Everyday Life | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2
A-Grade Paper:<br>- Robotics Exhibit/Concert: What you would do differently <br> *OR* <br> - Dr. Oliver Lecture: Relate to *Vehicles* and Brooks [1986]| &#10004;

* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to turn in 4 acceptable "Robotics Technology in Everyday Life" papers, you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if you complete one fewer *Vehicles* 4-14 Readings Summaries than required for a base grade. E.g. If you complete all requirements for a base grade of B, except you complete only 4 *Vehicles* 4-14 Readings Summaries, you will instead earn a course grade of B-.
* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if you have a total of 3 (or more) of the following at the end of the semester:
	* Unused tokens
	* Additional *Vehicles* 4-14 Readings Summaries (beyond the requirements for your base grade)
	* Additional Weeks 10-16 Design Notebook Entries (beyond the requirements for your base grade)
	* Additional *Robotics Technology in Everyday Life* analyses (beyond the requirements for your base grade)

*Note:*

* The limits for the number of assignments to be submitted in a single week still apply.
* WSU has no A+ grade.

## Lab Attendance

* For class sessions with a specific lab assignment, you are expected to work on the assigned laboratory material within your group. Every member of the group is expected to contribute. The group is expected to complete the lab assignment or make substantial progress toward the completion of the lab assignment. If you complete the assigned material before the end of class you must show the instructor before leaving.
* For class sessions with no specific lab assignment, you are expected to be working within your group toward completion of the competition task or your group's final project. Every member of the group is expected to contribute. Since it is unlikely that groups will finish the competition task or final project work entirely within class time, you will be expected to arrive at the beginning of the lab period (2:30pm), and not leave until the lab period is over (5:00pm).
* Arriving late and leaving early (unless you have finished and shown your work to the instructor) will result in your work being considered "Does Not Meet Specification" for that lab session.
* Working on things that are not part of the work for this class during class time will result in your work being considered "Does Not Meet Specification" for that lab session.

## Readings Summaries

You will be reading chapters from *Vehicles* by Braitenberg, as well as 2 journal articles about robotics.

* Everyone working to earn a passing grade must complete summaries of the Introduction, and Chapters 1 through 3 of *Vehicles*.
* Differing numbers of summaries for *Vehicles* chapters 4 through 14 are required for higher passing grades. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.
    * I will only accept one summary for *Vehicles* chapters 4-14 per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your summaries.**
* Everyone working to earn a passing grade must complete summaries of both journal articles.
* Summaries are expected to be short, concise and in your own words. Simply typing in selected sentences from the reading is not a summary, and will be considered acceptable (passing).

*A more complete specification for "Meets Specification" (passing) summaries will be given during the semester.*

## Engineering Design Notebooks

* Everyone working to earn a passing grade must complete notebook entries for the first 8 weeks of the semester.
* Everyone working to earn a passing grade must complete a differing number of notebook entries for weeks 10-16 of the semester. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.
    * I will only accept one notebook entry for weeks 10-16 per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your notebook entries.**

*A more complete specification for "Meets Specification" (passing) engineering design notebook entries will be given during the semester.*

## Final Project
For the last portion of the semester, each group will pick a project to complete and demonstrate to the class. The project must be chosen in consultation with the instructor and approved by the instructor. The final project demonstrations and presentations will be given during the scheduled Final Exam period on Thursday, 14 May 2020, 8:30-11:30am

* Everyone working to earn a passing grade must submit a "Meets Specification" final project proposal and give a "Meets Specification" final project presentation.

*A more complete specification for an "Meets Specification" (passing) final project and presentation will be given during the semester.*

## Robotics Exhibit/Concert
I am looking for an art exhibit or concert (or something similar) that uses robotics technology.
* Anyone working to earn a grade of C or higher must attend this (possibly virtually), and write up a summary of contents of the exhibit/concert and your impressions of the exhibit/concert.
* Anyone working to earn a grade of B or higher must also analyze the robotics elements of the pieces in the exhibit/concert, talking about the hardware (sensors and effectors) used, and how you think the software works. You should include pictures of the robotics hardware in the exhibit/concert.

*A more complete specification for a "Meets Specification" (passing) visit report and exhibit/concert analysis will be given during the semester.*

## Robotics Technology in Everyday Life

Robotics technology is in use all around us, in things we don't often think of as robots. Anything that has sensors and effectors, that changes its behavior or state based on sensor input, and manipulates the world around itself with effectors, can be considered a robot.

As you go about your everyday life, look at machines that you see and interact with, and think about what sensors and effectors it has, and what kind of control strategy or software it may use.

For each "robot" you encounter, write an analysis of its behavior, hardware and software.

* Differing numbers of analyses are required for different passing grades. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.
    * I will only accept one Robotics Technology in Everyday Life analysis per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your analyses.**

*A more complete specification for "Meets Specification" (passing) analyses will be given during the semester.*

## A-Grade Paper

Anyone working to earn a grade of A will be required to write a paper. There are two options for this paper:

* Robotics Exhibit/Concert: What you would do differently. &mdash; with your new-found knowledge of robotics hardware (sensors and effectors) and software (programming and control strategies), what would you change in the exhibit/concert?

*OR*

* Dr. Oliver Lecture: Relate to *Vehicles* and Brooks [1986] &mdash; write about the ethology material from Dr. Oliver's lecture and relate it to the readings in Braitenber's *Vehicles* book and to Brooks' [1986] paper.

*A more complete specification for a "Meets Specification" (passing) A-Grade paper will be given during the semester.*

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

* Due dates for assignments will be given with the assignment.* It is strongly recommended that you keep copies of your projects.* It is very important that you get started early on these projects. Robot projects are notoriously difficult to debug. Give yourself enough time to do so.

## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work

Because your first attempt at producing acceptable work for a new category of assignment may be difficult due to being unfamiliar with the specification and not having had any feedback yet, you may revise and resubmit ***a single*** assignment in each of the following categories *only*:

* *Vehicles* Reading Summary
* Article Reading Summary
* Engineering Design Notebook Entry, Labs 1-6
* Engineering Design Notebook Entry, Competition Project
* Engineering Design Notebook Entry, Weeks 10-16
* Robotics Technology in Everyday Life

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens in the first week. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Each token can be used to:

* replace a single missed class session (up to a maximum of 2 missed class sessions)
* turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* turn in a second *Vehicles* chapters 4-14 summary, notebook entry for weeks 10-16, or Robotics in Everyday Life analysis in an a single week
* revise and resubmit an assignment (up to a maximum of 3) that was judged "Does Not Meet Specification". Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date.

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up.

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/](http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst)) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-472]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.**

<span title="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795"><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795"><img src="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd042215s.gif" alt="Cartoon with bad examples of how to send email to your instructor."></a></span>

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University's Student Code of Conduct.

## Student Responsibilities

* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* When working with a partner, participate actively. Don't let your partner do all the work - you won't learn anything that way.
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the student support services (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Accessibility Statement
Worcester State University is committed to providing reasonable academic accommodations for all students with disabilities.  If you have a disability and are concerned about the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation.  Students must be registered with Student Accessibility Services in order to receive academic accommodations.  Student Accessibility Services is located in the Administration Building, Room 131, and can be reached by phone (508/929-8733 or email (sas@worcester.edu).  Please notify me if you need this syllabus in an alternative format.

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the Academic Success Center (ASC).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible or contact the Tutoring Coordinator at 508-929-8139

## The Math Center
The Math Center provides free assistance to students in Mathematics.  It is located on the first floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S143.

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.

To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center’s hours and the Center’s Online Writing Lab, visit their website at [www.worcester.edu/writing]()

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts.

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/](http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/)**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**

## Student Work Retention Policy
It is my policy to securely dispose of student work one calendar year after grades have been submitted for a course.

## Robot Ownership and Consent
<font color=red>By default, individual robots are the sole property of the individual groups responsible for them. Appropriate consent must be obtained from the owners before any changes are made to code or mechanical design.</font> Within a group, this means that all the group members must agree upon the changes to be made (or at least authorize someone to make changes, whatever they may be, as necessary). <font color=red>Failure to obtain necessary consent for modifications (within a group) will lower a student's grade (whatever it would have been otherwise) by one full letter grade.
**Intentionally damaging, disabling, tampering with, or in any other way interfering with the robots, kits, or software of other groups during the course of the semester will lead to immediate expulsion from the course, a grade of F, and other disciplinary action at the college level. I expect never to have to invoke this policy.**
</font>

## Equipment Availability

***Unfortunately, we no longer have a dedicated lab/classroom space for this course. That means that we will have to move the equipment to/from the classroom for each class session.***

**The robotics equipment is stored in ST 110G.** I will make sure the room is unlocked before class begins.

**To get access to the equipment outside of class time, you will need to have the room unlocked.** It will generally be available M-F 8:15am-4:15pm. See the CS Department Secretary (Terri) or me to have the room opened for you.

The door to the room must be closed and locked when you leave. The robotics equipment may not leave the 1st floor of the Ghosh Science and Technology Building, so your work on these projects will have to be done on campus.

## Space Availability
The following spaces are available for you to work outside of class time:

* The Robotics equipment room (ST 110G). There are two benches available in that room. You must not block access the equipment for other classmates.
* Classrooms &mdash; Free Times (Subject to Change)
    * ST 103
        * Mondays until 2:00pm and after 3:30pm
        * Wednesdays 9:30-11:30am and  after 3:30pm
        * Thursdays after 2:30pm
        * Fridays 9:30-11:30am and after 1:30pm
    * ST 105
        * Mondays 11:30am-12:20pm and after 1:30pm
        * Wednesdays after 3:30pm
        * Thursdays after 2:30pm
        * Fridays 8:30-9:20am, 11:30am-12:20pm, and after 1:30pm
    * ST 107
        * Mondays and Wednesdays after 3:30pm
        * Tuesdays and Thursdays 8:30-9:45pm, 11:30am-12:45pm, and after 2:30pm
        * Fridays 8:30-9:20am and after 12:30pm
    * The cubicle outside ST 110C.

***Please be considerate of other students and faculty in the ST 110 office area. Keep your noise levels down and do not block offices and walkways. If there are complaints, I will have to stop you from working in the office area.***
